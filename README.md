# Zigbee-Control-Center

This project aims to create a local, self-hosted smart home control center using a Raspberry Pi and ESP32-C6. The system will leverage Zigbee protocol to provide reliable, cloud-independent home automation with unified control.

A **local, unified Zigbee control center** that operates independently of cloud services, consolidates device control, and uses dedicated low-power mesh networking to preserve WiFi bandwidth.
